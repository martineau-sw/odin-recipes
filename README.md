HTML Foundations project assignment within The Odin Project 

## Introduction

This first project is an exercise of the material covered in The Odin Project up to the HTML Foundations section in the Foundations Unit. This includes prerequisite knowledge of the
web, internet infrastructure, and fundamental components and operations needed for web content. Introductory skills wih Git, GitHub, and HTML are demonstrated at the completion of this project.

## Reflection

For the recipes, I featured low-cost instant meals. I don't recommend anyone eating these, but
I'm sure we've all been there. To fill out the content, I heavily referenced the product pages 
for the content of the recipe pages. 

The ingredients in all recipes are as labeled in the nutrition facts, but I formatted them to lists where they often are comma delimited. This also granted the opportunity to nest lists where additional ingredients are listed paranthetically, describing contents of flour, for instance. 

As for the description and steps sections, only the Hot Pockets website provided this information. For the others, I wrote them in as I would prepare them (not that anyone would need flavor text or assistance preparing these anyway).
